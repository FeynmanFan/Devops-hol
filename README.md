# Welcome to the Hands-on Labs! 
## This repo is intended for use with the CourseCareers course *Intro to DevOps*.

There are three labs:

1. A Jenkins pipeline build to get your feet wet with real build engineering
2. A Dockerfile which needs an adjustment to work correctly
3. A bash script which needs implementation

These labs have two objectives:
1. To refresh and root what you've learned in the course
2. To take you one, single step beyond what you've learned in the course and encourage you to exercise your research skills

To complete the labs, do the following:
1. Navigate to the subfolder of the lab you wish to complete

2. Fork the repo specified in the instructions.

3. Follow the instructions to complete the lab, and save the asset that the instructions specify in your local copy of the subfolder.

4. Commit your local copy to your forked repo in Github

5. Paste your forked repo url in the Devops-Hands-On-Labs Discord channel

Here is my explicit permission to view others' work! Looking at code that other people have written is an important part of being a technical professional; absent some formal constraint, this is not *cheating*, it is not lazy (except in the positive sense of Lazy Programmer), and put simply, no decent programmer does NOT review examples of how to solve problems - that's just not how it works.

### Completion of these labs is required

This is intended as a resource to aid your education and comfort level, and get you comfortable with the nuts and bolts processes that you are likely to encounter on the first week of your job. 

###Please ask questions in the Discord!!!
That's a big part of what it's for. Feel free to review other learner's repos, and make yours available in the same way.
